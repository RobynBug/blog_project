            <p> There are great benefits to cooking at home. One is knowing the ingredients that make up your dish.
                This puts you in control of what enters your body. However, cooking can also
                be a hobby, an expressive artform that you can share with your friends and family.
                Cooking can bring your family closer together, encourage a picky eater to try new things,
                and create moments that can last a lifetime.

                I have always loved cooking and sharing with my family what I was able to create.
                When I became a mother, I started to notice how disconnected I was from spending time with
                my family when I was cooking. I also noticed that I was making separate dinners because my daughter                                                                                                                    
                was picky and allergic to many of the ingredients I commonly used.

                In search of a solution, I took her into the kitchen with me. An explosion of
                artful expression ensued; she has not stopped cooking since. She loves to try her new dishes
                and searches for recipes to add to her skill set. Cooking in my family has evolved into an everyday
                family function that extends beyond my household bringing my sisters to enjoy it with us
